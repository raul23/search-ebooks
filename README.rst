`search-ebooks`_ is a command-line program that searches through content
and metadata of different types of ebooks. It is based on the `pyebooktools`_
Python package for building ebook management scripts (e.g. conversion of ebooks 
to ``.txt`` in order to then search on them)

`:warning:`

  * For the moment, the ``search-ebooks`` script is only tested on **macOS**.
    It will be tested also on linux.
  * **More to come!** Check the `Roadmap <#roadmap>`_ to know what is coming
    soon.

Introduction
============
``search-ebooks`` allows you to choose the search methods for the different ebook formats.
These are the supported search-backends for each type of ebooks:

+---------------+----------------------------------------------------------+
| File type     | Supported search-backends                                |
+===============+==========================================================+
| ``.djvu``     | 1. `djvutxt`_ (**default**)                              |
|               | 2. `ebook-convert`_                                      |
+---------------+----------------------------------------------------------+
| ``.epub``     | 1. `ebook-convert`_ (**default**)                        |
|               | 2. ``epubtxt``                                           |
+---------------+----------------------------------------------------------+
| ``.doc`` [1]_ | 1. `catdoc`_ or `textutil`_ (if on macOS) (**default**)  |
|               | 2. `ebook-convert`_                                      |
+---------------+----------------------------------------------------------+
| ``.pdf``      | 1. `pdftotext`_ (**default**)                            |
|               | 2. `ebook-convert`_                                      |
+---------------+----------------------------------------------------------+

`:information_source:`

  * The utilities mentioned in the **Supported search-backends** column
    are used to extract the text before it is searched on.
  * More specifically, ``epubtxt`` consists in uncompressing first the 
    ``epub`` file with `unzip`_ since ``epub``\s are zipped HTML files. Then, 
    the extracted text is searched on. I tried to use `zipgrep`_ to do
    both the unzipping and searching but I couldn't make it to work with
    regular expressions such as ``\bpattern\b``.
  * The **default** search methods (except for ``.epub``) are used since 
    they are quicker to extract text than *calibre*\'s `ebook-convert`_. But 
    if these default utilities are not installed, then the searching relies on 
    ``ebook-convert`` for converting the documents to ``.txt``
  * Eventually, I will add support for `Lucene`_ as a search backend since it 
    has "powerful indexing and search features, as well as spellchecking, hit 
    highlighting and advanced analysis/tokenization capabilities".

`:warning:`

  I didn't set ``epubtxt`` as a default search-backend for ``epub`` files 
  because it also includes the HTML tags in the extracted text even though 
  text extraction is faster than with `ebook-convert`_.
  
  Once I clean up the extracted text, I will set ``epubtxt`` as a default
  search method for ``epub`` files if it is still faster than ``ebook-convert``
  for text extraction.

|

All the utilities that extract text make use of a file-based `cache`_ to save
the converted ebook files to ``.txt`` and hence speed up the searching by a
lot. Depending on the number of files searched, the searching can even be 20
times faster with cache than without it (TODO: add tests to show performance
of searching with cache and no cache).
   
Dependencies
============
Python dependencies
-------------------
* **Platforms:** macOS [soon linux]
* **Python**: >= **3.6**
* `diskcache`_ >= **5.2.1** for caching persistently the converted files into
  ``.txt``
* `pyebooktools`_ >= **0.1.0a3** for converting files to ``.txt`` (see
  `convert_to_txt.py`_) along with its library `lib.py`_ that has useful
  functions for building ebook management scripts.

Other dependencies
-------------------
As explained in the documentation for 
`pyebooktools <https://github.com/raul23/pyebooktools#other-dependencies>`__, 
you need recent version of:

* `calibre`_ to convert ebook files to ``.txt`` and get metadata from ebooks
  
And optionally, you might need:

* (**Highly recommended**) `poppler`_, `catdoc`_ and `DjVuLibre`_ 
  can be installed for faster than calibre's conversion of ``.pdf``, ``.doc``
  and ``.djvu`` files respectively to ``.txt``.
* `Tesseract`_ for running OCR on books - version 4 gives better results
  even though it's still in alpha. OCR is disabled by default since it 
  is a slow resource-intensive process.
  
  `:warning:`
   
    On macOS, you don't need ``catdoc`` since `textutil`_ is already
    present

.. TODO: add these options
.. * `Lucene`_ for a powerful search library
.. (for Tesseract) and another engine can be configured if preferred.

Cache
=====
Cache is used to save the converted ebook files into ``.txt`` to avoid
re-converting them which is a time consuming process, specially if
it is a document with hundreds of pages. `DiskCache`_, a disk and file backed
cache library, is used by the ``search-ebooks`` script.

A file-based cache library was choosen instead of a memory-based 
cache like `Redis`_ because the converted files (``.txt``) needed to be 
persistent to speed up subsequent searches and since we are storing huge
quantities of data (e.g. we can have thousands of ebooks to search from), 
a memory-based cache might not be suited. In order to avoid using too much 
disk space, you can set the cache size with the ``--cache-size-limit`` flag
which by default it is set to 1 GB.

As an example to see how much disk space you might need to cache one thousand
``.txt`` files all at once, let's say that on average each ``.txt`` file uses
approximately 700 KB which roughly corresponds to a file with 350 pages. 
Thus, you will need a cache size of at least 700 MB.

Also `DiskCache`_ has interesting features compared to other file-based 
cache libraries such as being thread-safe and process-safe and supporting 
multiple eviction policies. See `Features`_ for a more complete list.

See `DiskCache Cache Benchmarks`_ for comparaisons to `Memcached`_ and 
`Redis`_.

Examples
========
We will present search examples that are not trivial in order to show the
potential of the ``search-ebooks`` script for executing complex queries.

This is the ``~/ebooks/`` folder that contains the files which we will search
from in the following examples:

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raul23/images/master/search-ebooks/readme/examples/list_of_ebooks.png
   :target: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raul23/images/master/search-ebooks/readme/examples/list_of_ebooks.png
   :align: left
   :alt: List of ebooks to search from

`:information_source:`

  Of the total eight PDF files, two are files that contain only
  images: *Les MiseÃÅrables by Victor Hugo.pdf* and 
  *The Republic by Plato.pdf* which both consist of only two images for 
  testing purposes.

Search ebooks whose filenames satisfy a given pattern
-----------------------------------------------------
We want to search for the word "knowledge" but only for those ebooks whose
filenames contain either "Aristotle" or "Plato" and also we want the search
to be case insensitive (i.e. ignore case):

.. code:: bash

   $ search-ebooks ~/ebooks/ --query "\bknowledge\b" --filename "Aristotle|Plato" -i --use-cache

`:information_source:`

  * ``\bknowledge\b`` matches exactly the word "knowledge", i.e. it performs a 
    `‚Äúwhole words only‚Äù search`_. Thus, words like "acknowledge" or "knowledgeable"
    are rejected.
  * Since we already converted the files to ``.txt`` in previous runs,
    we make use of the cache with the ``--use-cache`` flag.

**Output:**

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raul23/images/master/search-ebooks/readme/examples/output_filenames_satisfy_pattern.png
   :target: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raul23/images/master/search-ebooks/readme/examples/output_filenames_satisfy_pattern.png
   :align: left
   :alt: Output for example: filenames satisfy a given pattern

`:information_source:`

  * The ``txt`` and ``pdf`` versions of *The Ethics of Aristotle by Aristotle*
    show different number of matches because they are not the same translations
    and hence the word *knowledge* might come from the introduction (written by 
    another author) or the translator's footnotes.
  * On the other hand, the ``txt`` and ``epub`` versions of *Politics_ A 
    Treatise on Government by Aristotle* show the same number of matches because
    they are both the same translation.
  * As explained previously, *The Republic by Plato.pdf* is not included in
    the matches because it is a file with images only and since
    we didn't use the ``--ocr`` flag, the file couldn't be converted to ``.txt``.

Search documents with images 
----------------------------
We will execute the `previous query`_ but this time we will include the
file *The Republic by Plato.pdf* (which contains images) in the search by 
using the ``--ocr`` flag which will convert the images to text with `Tesseract`_:

.. code:: bash

   $ search-ebooks ~/ebooks/ --query "\bknowledge\b" --filename "Aristotle|Plato" -i --use-cache --ocr

`:information_source:`
 
  * The ``--ocr`` flag allows you to search ``.pdf``, ``.djvu`` and image files but it
    is disabled by default because `OCR`_ is a slow resource-intensive process.
  * Since the file *The Republic by Plato.pdf* was not already processed, the cache 
    didn't have its text conversion at the start of the script. But by the end of the
    script, the text conversion was saved in the cache.

**Output:**

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raul23/images/master/search-ebooks/readme/examples/output_ocr_images.png
   :target: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raul23/images/master/search-ebooks/readme/examples/output_ocr_images.png
   :align: left
   :alt: Output for example: OCR PDF file with images

`:warning:`

  As you can see from the seach time, OCR is a slow process. Thus, use it wisely!
  
Search ebook metadata
---------------------
Search for the string "confront|treason|journal" but only for those ebooks that have the 
"fiction" **and** "play" tags:

.. code:: bash

   $ search-ebooks ~/ebooks/ --query "confront|treason|journal" --tags "^(?=.*fiction)(?=.*play).*$ -i --use-cache

`:information_source:`

Tips
====
Use ``--search-regex`` for regex-based search
---------------------------------------------
Use the ``--search-regex`` flag to perform regex-based search of ebook contents.
Thus: 

* ``--query "a battle"`` will find any line that **contains** the words 
  "a battle". 
* ``--query "^a battle" --search-regex`` will find any line that **starts** 
  with the words "a battle" because the ``--search-regex`` flag considers the 
  search query as a regex.

`:information_source:`

  * By default, the ``search-ebooks`` script considers the search queries as 
    non-regex, i.e. it searches for the given query anywhere in the text.
  * If you want to perform a regex-based search of ebook **metadata** such as 
    filenames then use the ``--metadata-regex`` flag, e.g. 
    ``--filename "Aristotle|Plato" --metadata-regex`` will return all filenames
    that contain either "Aristotle" or "Plato".

Perform "full word" search and other types of search
----------------------------------------------------
The ``search-ebooks`` script accepts regular expressions for the search queries
through the ``--search-regex`` and ``--metadata-regex`` flags.
Thus you can perform specific searches such as a "full word" search (also
called "whole words only" search) or a "starts with" search by making use of 
regex-based search queries.

This is how you would perform some of the important types of search based on 
regular expressions:

+---------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------+
| Search type               | Regex                                                        | Examples                                     |
+===========================+==============================================================+==============================================+
| "full word" search        | ``\bword\b``: surround the word with the `\\b`_ anchor       | ``--query "\bknowledge\b" --sr``:            |
|                           |                                                              | will match exactly the word "knowledge" thus |
|                           |                                                              | words like "acknowledge" or "knowledgeable"  |
|                           |                                                              | will be rejected                             |
+---------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------+
| "starts with" search      | ``^string``: add the caret ``^`` before the string           | ``--query "^Th" --sr``:                      |
|                           | to match lines that start with the given string              | will find all lines that start with          |
|                           |                                                              | the characters "Th"                          |
+---------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------+
| "ends with" search        | ``string$``: add the dollar sign ``$`` at the end of         | ``--query "through the$" --sr``:             |
|                           | the string to match all lines that start with the given      | will find all lines that end with            |
|                           | string                                                       | the words "through the"                      |
+---------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------+
| "contains pattern" search | * ``string``: a regex without tokens will find the           | * ``--query "^The|disputed.$" --sr``:        |
|                           |   string anywhere in the text even if it is part of a word.  |   will find all lines that                   |
|                           | * ``string1|string2``: searches for the literal text         |   either start with "The" or end             |
|                           |   *string1* or *string2*. The vertical bar is called         |   with "disputed."                           |
|                           |   the `alternation operator`_.                               | * ``--filename "Aristotle|Plato" --mr``:     |
|                           |                                                              |   will select those ebooks whose filenames   |
|                           |                                                              |   contain either "Aristotle" or "Plato"      |
+---------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------+

`:information_source:`

  The ``--sr`` and ``--mr`` flags in the examples are the short versions of ``--search-regex`` 
  and ``--metadata-regex`` flags, respectively.  They allow you to perform **regex-based** 
  search of ebook's content and metadata, respectively.

Roadmap
=======
Starting from first priority tasks:

1. Add many tests with many ebooks (in the thousands maybe)

   **Status:** working on it

2. Add examples for searching text content and metadata of ebooks
   
   **Status:** working on it
   
3. Add instructions on how to install the ``searchebooks`` package

4. Add support for `Lucene`_ as a search backend
   
   `PyLucene`_ will be used to access ``Lucene``\'s text indexing and searching
   capabilities from Python
   
5. Test on linux
6. Create a `docker`_ image for this project
7. Read also metadata from *calibre*\'s ``metadata.opf`` if found
8. Add tests on `Travis CI`_
9. Eventually add documentation on `Read the Docs`_
10. Add support for multiprocessing so you can have multiple ebook files
    being searched in parallel based on the number of cores
11. Implement a GUI, specially to make navigation of search results easier 
    since you can have thousands of matches for a given search query
  
    Though, for the moment not sure which GUI library to choose from 
    (e.g. `Kivy`_, `TkInter`_)
