Tests
=====
Search through the content of eight PDF files for the word **hold**
which is accomplished with the regex ``\bhold\b``. Thus for
example, we want *hold* but not *holdings*.

Searching content of PDF files with ``pdftotext``
-------------------------------------------------
We will use the ``pdftotext`` utility to convert PDF files to ``txt`` in order
to search through content for a given pattern.

By default, the ``seach-ebooks`` script uses ``pdftotext`` since it is way
faster than *calibre*\'s ``ebook-convert`` to convert files to ``txt``.

The ``pdftotext``'s results are given for two cases: with and without cache.
Cache is used to save the converted PDF files into ``txt`` so that we avoid
re-converting PDF files which is a very time consuming process, specially if
it is a huge document. 

Summary of results
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Using cache, we are able to decrease the search time by **4.7**

+-----------------------------+----------------+
|             Case            | Time (seconds) |
+=============================+================+
| ``pdftotext`` with cache    | **1.036**      |
+-----------------------------+----------------+
| ``pdftotext`` without cache | 4.304          |
+-----------------------------+----------------+

With cache
^^^^^^^^^^
This is the command which makes use of ``pdftotext`` for searching and cache to save the converted
PDF files into ``txt``:

.. code:: bash

   $ search-ebooks ~/ebooks/ --query "\bhold\b" -f pdf --use-cache
   
**Output:** ``pdftotext`` and cache

Without cache
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This is the command which makes use of ``pdftotext`` for searching but doesn't use cache:

.. code:: bash

   $ search-ebooks ~/ebooks/ --query "\bhold\b" -f pdf
   
**Output:** ``pdftotext`` and no cache
